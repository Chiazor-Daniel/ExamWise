- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), near-white but with a hint of the primary color, to ensure readability and reduce eye strain during long study sessions.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FF9800) to highlight important elements like calls to action and key information.
- Body text: 'Inter' sans-serif, for a modern, machined look and good readability.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, for a techy, scientific feel. Use 'Inter' for body text if longer text passages are anticipated.
- Use minimalist icons to represent subjects and question categories.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions.
